    {
      question: "What is a multisig wallet?",
      answer: "A multisig (multi-signature) wallet requires multiple approvals before executing transactions. Instead of one key controlling everything, control is distributed among multiple owners with a configurable threshold (e.g., 2 of 3 owners must approve)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I create a multisig vault?",
      answer: "Connect your wallet, click 'Create' in the sidebar, add owner addresses, set a threshold, and deploy. You'll need to approve two transactions: one for the implementation and one for your vault proxy."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between proposing, approving, and executing?",
      answer: "Proposing creates a transaction that needs approvals. Approving adds your signature to a proposal. Executing actually performs the on-chain action once enough approvals are collected."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change the owners or threshold after deployment?",
      answer: "Yes! You can add/remove owners and change the threshold through multisig transactions. These are self-calls to the vault contract and require threshold approvals."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I lose access to my owner key?",
      answer: "If you have Social Recovery configured, guardians can help recover access. Otherwise, the remaining owners can remove you and add a new owner. If you're the only owner or lose all keys, the vault may become inaccessible."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Social Recovery work?",
      answer: "Guardians can initiate recovery to replace owners. After threshold guardian approvals and a time delay, the recovery can be executed. Current owners can cancel recoveries during the delay period."
    },
    {
      question: "What are modules and why should I use them?",
      answer: "Modules extend vault functionality. Social Recovery enables wallet recovery, Daily Limits allow quick small transactions, and Whitelist pre-approves trusted addresses. All modules are optional."
    },
    {
      question: "Can transactions be cancelled?",
      answer: "Yes. The proposer can cancel immediately, or any owner can cancel if the transaction has reached threshold approvals. Once executed, transactions cannot be cancelled."
    },
    {
      question: "How much gas do transactions cost?",
      answer: "Gas costs vary: proposing (~50-100k), approving (~45-80k), executing (variable based on target contract), cancelling (~30-50k). The frontend estimates gas and adds buffers automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Quai Vault audited?",
      answer: "The contracts are currently on testnet and pre-audit. A formal security audit is planned before mainnet deployment. All code is open source for review."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this on mainnet?",
      answer: "Currently, Quai Vault is deployed on Orchard Testnet only. Do not store significant funds. Mainnet deployment will follow testing and audits."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a recovery doesn't execute automatically?",
      answer: "Recoveries require manual execution - they don't happen automatically. Once conditions are met (threshold approvals + time delay), anyone can call executeRecovery(). The frontend shows an 'Execute Recovery' button when ready."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have multiple modules enabled at once?",
      answer: "Yes! All modules work independently and can be enabled simultaneously. For example, you can have Social Recovery, Daily Limits, and Whitelist all active at the same time."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I verify a transaction on-chain?",
      answer: "Use the transaction lookup feature or check the transaction hash on a block explorer. All transactions emit events that can be queried on-chain."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I approve a transaction by mistake?",
      answer: "You cannot revoke an approval, but you can cancel the transaction if you're the proposer or if it has reached threshold approvals. Always verify transaction details before approving."
